      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
      
        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>

What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
responsive is fluid and adapts to the size of the screen no matter what the target device. Adaptive design, on the other hand, uses static layouts based on breakpoints which don't respond once they're initially loaded.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
actually a design strategy (mobile-first), while the latter is the result of a technical approach (responsive). ... By doing so, they initially design a website for the smallest mobile devices possible and then scale upwards to adapt to desktop computers

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. ... These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain. To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server.
